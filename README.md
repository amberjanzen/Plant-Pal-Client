Plant Pal is a web application that allows you to organize your house plant collection so that you can properly care for your plant babies. No longer will your plants suffer the fate of over watering or underwatering. This web app is a way to digitaly store and organize proper care instructions for your plant. 

the initial build of this web application was created for a final course requirement at Eleven Fifty Academy upon graduation of the Web Development BootCamp in October 2020.

The build of Plant Pal utilizes postgresql, nodejs, react legacy with class components and typescript in order to create a full-stack web application.

With Plant Pal, users have full CRUD capabilities where they can login and/or register as a user and post, edit, update, and delete plants and their corresponding locations. Upon logging in or signing up, users will initially add locations or rooms where they can add descriptions of the lighting and general environment. Once a location is created, a user can then add plants that they have placed in those locations. This will allow users to organize their plants and add descriptions and care instructions that will result in healthy, long living plants.

This iteration of Plant Pal is in its initial phase.
